# HireMind Frontend Refactor (Updated)

## New Flow
1.  **/** (Default): **Student** Login/Signup Page.
2.  **/hr**: **HR** Login/Signup Page.
3.  **Navigation**: The Student page has a link "Are you a Recruiter?" pointing to `/hr`. The HR page has a link "Are you a Student?" pointing to `/`.

## Layout Fixes
